- For my final project I would like to make a functioning, and playable, Rubik's cube. 
    Example: https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51K7YxVuk2L._AC_SS350_.jpg
    The example is of a 3x3 cube, larger variants do exist but I plan to make a 3x3
- I plan to implement my aplication using THREE.js
- I plan to make each side of the Rubik's cube a diffrent image, or color if I run out of time.
- The player will be able to rotate the cube using the mouse, or keyboard.
- The sides of the cube will be rotatable using buttons on the side
